# Post-Mortem Report: Backend Service Outage

## Incident Summary
- **Date**: [DATE]
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes
- **Impact**: Backend API unavailable, frontend degraded functionality
- **Root Cause**: Simulated container failure

## Timeline
- **T+0**: Backend container stopped (simulated failure)
- **T+1min**: Monitoring detected service unavailability
- **T+2min**: Service restored by restarting container

## What Went Well
- Monitoring system detected the failure quickly
- Recovery process was straightforward
- Frontend remained partially functional

## What Could Be Improved
- Implement health checks with automatic restart
- Add service redundancy
- Improve alerting mechanisms

## Action Items
1. Configure Docker restart policies
2. Implement load balancing for critical services
3. Set up automated alerting
4. Create runbooks for common failures
